### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in programming languages and compilers.

During my Masters, I worked towards improving software designs for computer algebra and
error-correcting codes in C++ using generic and metaprogramming.

During my assitantship at SFedU, I adviced students on topics in functional
programming: datatype-generic programming, monads for structuring effects,
linear types for expressing resource management and quantum computing.

During my PhD, I was focusing
on an assessment of the design and implementation of the Julia programming language
([OOPSLA '18][2], [OOPSLA '21][oopsla21], [VMIL '23][vmil23]). I'm still looking into Julia's
notion of type stability — the topic of my [PhD dissertation](Papers/2023-dissertation.pdf).

While on postdoc with Milind, I am looking into making irregular computations
(tree traversals) more efficient. Our main topics are:
- functional programming with densely represented datatypes (the [Gibbon
  compiler][gibbon]; e.g. [arXiv:2405.17590][marmoset] to appear at ECOOP'24),
- general-purpose computations on ray-tracing hardware (e.g.
  [arXiv:2311.09168][arkade] nominated for **best paper award** at ICS'24),
- sparse tensors computations (e.g. [arXiv:2311.09549][sparseauto], in submission).

<!--
- compilers for fully homomorphic encryption (such as [Coyote][coyote]).
