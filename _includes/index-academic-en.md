### Research Interests

I am interested in typed functional programming and corresponding languages (mostly, Haskell),
type and effect systems, [mathematics of program construction][1]. In the past, I worked
towards better software engineering principles of building computer algebra software in C++,
especially using what C++ world knows as _generic programming_. 

Recently, I was working
on a assessment of the design and implementation of Julia programming language
([OOPSLA'18][2], [OOPSLA '21][oopsla21]). Currently, I'm studying Julia's
notion of type stability.

More about my professional interests can be found in my [Curriculum Vit√¶](cv.pdf).
