### Research Interests

I am interested in typed functional programming and corresponding languages (mostly, Haskell),
type and effect systems, [mathematics of program construction][1]. In the past, I worked
towards better software engineering principles of building computer algebra software in C++,
especially using what C++ world knows as _generic programming_. 

During my PhD, I was focusing
on an assessment of the design and implementation of Julia programming language
([OOPSLA '18][2], [OOPSLA '21][oopsla21], [VMIL '23][vmil23]). I'm still looking into Julia's
notion of type stability — the topic of my [PhD dissertation](Papers/2023-dissertation.pdf).

While on postdoc with Milind, I am looking into efficient irregular computations
(trees instead of arrays). Our main topics are:
- functional programming with densely represented datatypes (the [Gibbon
  compiler][gibbon]; e.g. [arXiv:2405.17590][marmoset] to appear at ECOOP'24),
- general-purpose computations on ray-tracing hardware (e.g.
  [arXiv:2311.09168][arkade] nominated for **best paper award** at ICS'24),
- sparse tensors computations (e.g. [arXiv:2311.09549][sparseauto] in submission).

<!--
- compilers for fully homomorphic encryption (such as [Coyote][coyote]).
