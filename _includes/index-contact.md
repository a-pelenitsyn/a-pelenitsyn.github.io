Schedule a meeting with me (Zoom or Purdue campus) â€”
[using Calendly](https://calendly.com/artem-pe/chat).
I'm more likely to be on campus on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays.
Otherwise, we can agree on wheather Zoom or in-person makes more sense.

Use my email (above) or any social network to reach out if you think talking to
me can be helpful. Especially welcome are students deciding on their possible
academic career.
