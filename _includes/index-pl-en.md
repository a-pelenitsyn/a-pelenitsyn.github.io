### Programming Languages in The Real World™

I'm interested in programming (or, more generally, “software”) languages as they
pertain to software and systems, e.g.
programming languages' ecosystems (especially, Haskell and Julia's ones),
build systems and software package managers (especially, the Nix package manager and NixOS),
verified software via interactive theorem provers and dependent types (Coq, Agda, Idris),
modal editing (in the spirit of `vi`) and (Doom) Emacs, Linux and Open Source Software.
Check out:

* My contributions to the [GHC Haskell compiler][ghc] and the [Cabal package
  manager][cabal] — the pillars of Haskell ecosystem (fun fact: I'm one of the Cabal
  maintainers currently).
* [Blog post about my internship at Tweag I/O in 2019][4] where I developed a bridge between GHC and the Bazel build system.
